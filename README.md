# open-craftos
Run ComputerCraft's CraftOS on OpenComputers. Why? Because.

## Installation

You'll need to clone this repo to your OC computer, and place the included `bios.lua` (very slightly modified; has error stacktraces enabled) into `/rom`, which should also contain the default ComputerCraft: Tweaked ROM.

The easiest way to get the ROM is likely to use an Adapter to send it using a CC floppy disk. Note that this will *not* copy the BIOS and you must use the included one.
